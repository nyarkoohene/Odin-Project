# Odin-Project
Hello Reader,my name is Ohene Narko and i started  this project starting Deceber 3,2024.Unfortunately i became occupied and distracted a bit so was unable to be consistent.
Today January 14,2025 i am resuming my work on this project and pledge to remain focussed till i am done. 
I am doing this with the aim of getting my web development fundamentals right this time around, 
and then building on it to be skilled enough to have a career in tech.
