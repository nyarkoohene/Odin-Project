# Odin-Project
Hello Reader, my name is Ohene Nyarko and i started  this project on  December 3,2024. Unfortunately i became occupied and distracted a bit  so i  was unable to be consistent.
Today January 14,2025 i am resuming my work on this project and pledge to remain focussed till i am done. 
I am doing this with the aim of getting my web development fundamentals right this time around, and then building on it to be skilled enough to have a career in tech.
