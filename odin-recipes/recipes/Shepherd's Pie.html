    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Shepherd's Pie is a traditional British dish made with ground lamb (or beef, 
        if using cottage pie) cooked with vegetables like peas, carrots, and onions, 
        in a savory gravy. The mixture is topped with creamy mashed potatoes and baked until golden brown. 
        It's a comforting, hearty meal often served as a family favorite. 
        The dish is perfect for using up leftovers and is popular in colder months.
